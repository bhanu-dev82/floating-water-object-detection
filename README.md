# floating-water-object-detection

This project was created for final year project of one of my senior.
The pourpose is served.
Initial achivement of this projects are :
* succesful detection of floating water waste
* turns on the elevator when the waste is detected

Limitations :
* only floating water bottle is detected, leaves and such garbage is not detected (to-do)
* need to work on automatic cleaning algorithm, curretly it is trival
  (just move in squares which get smaller with every round)

** Future Plans **
Actually the problem of floating water waste is global. Many resources are invested with significant requirement of man-power to clean our rivers and sea, if we all can work out an open-sourced algorithm which addreses this issue, we can contribut to a cleaner and smart word.

Will update further, till then happy to recive contributions and excited to make a change
